# `page-gen`

`page-gen` is (or, I suppose, will be) a simple webpage generator that will use a templating system with variables.

This project is in super early development and as such the code will *not* generate webpage as of today. For a general idea on what I'm aiming to do,
see the format documentation [here](format.md), and for basic usage, the usage documentation [here](usage.md).
